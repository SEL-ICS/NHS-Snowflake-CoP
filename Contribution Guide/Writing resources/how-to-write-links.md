# Use links in documentation

This article describes how to use hyperlinks from pages hosted in the Snowflake Community of Practice.

Links are easy to add into markdown with a few varying conventions. Links point users to content in the same page, in other neighboring pages, or on external sites and URLs.

The Markdown flavor used by the project is compatible with [GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)][GFM], as most docs are stored in GitHub and can be edited there.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All links must be secure (`https` vs `http`) whenever the target supports it.

## Link text

The words that you include in link text should be friendly. In other words, they should be normal English words or the title of the page that you're linking to.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not use "click here" as link text. It's bad for search engine optimization and doesn't adequately describe the target.

## Links from one article to another

There are two types of hyperlinks supported by the publishing system: **URLs** and **file links**.

A URL link can be a URL path that is relative to the root of `https://learn.microsoft.com`, or an absolute URL that includes the full URL syntax (for example, `https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs`).

- Use URL links when linking to content outside of the current _docset_ or between autogenerated reference and conceptual articles within the docset.
- The simplest way to create a relative link is to copy the URL from your browser, then remove `https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us` from the value you paste into markdown.
- Do not include locales in URLs for Microsoft properties (for example, remove `/en-us` from the URL).

A file link is used to link from one article to another within the docset or repository.

- All file paths use forward-slash (`/`) characters instead of back-slash characters.
- An article links to another article in the same directory:

  `[link text](article-name.md)`

- An article links to an article in the parent directory of the current directory:

  `[link text](../article-name.md)`

- An article links to an article in a subdirectory of the current directory:

  `[link text](directory/article-name.md)`

- An article links to an article in a subdirectory of the parent directory of the current directory:

  `[link text](../directory/article-name.md)`

> [!NOTE]
> None of the previous examples use the `~/` as part of the link. To link to an absolute path that begins at the root of the repository, start the link with `/`. Including the `~/` produces invalid links when navigating the source repositories on GitHub. Starting the path with `/` resolves correctly.

## Bookmark links

For a bookmark link to a heading in the *current* file, use a hash symbol followed by the lowercase words of the heading. Remove punctuation from the heading and replace spaces with dashes:

```markdown
[Managed Disks](#managed-disks)
```

To link to a bookmark heading in another article, use the file-relative or site-relative link plus a hash symbol, followed by the words of the heading. Remove punctuation from the heading and replace spaces with dashes:

```markdown
[Managed Disks](../../linux/overview.md#managed-disks)
```

You can also copy the bookmark link from the URL. To find the URL, hover your mouse over the heading line on the relavant article. You should see a link icon appear.

Click the link icon and then copy the bookmark anchor text from the URL (that is, the part after the hash).

> [!TIP]
> Some markdown extension plug-ins have tools to help create links.

### Explicit anchor links

Adding explicit anchor links using the `<a>` HTML tag isn't required or recommended, except in hub and landing pages. Instead, use the auto-generated bookmarks as described in [bookmark links](#bookmark-links). For hub and landing pages, declare anchors as follows:

```markdown
## <a id="anchortext" />Header text
```

or

```markdown
## <a name="anchortext" />Header text
```

And the following to link to the anchor:

```markdown
To go to a section on the same page:
[text](#anchortext)

To go to a section on another page.
[text](filename.md#anchortext)
```

> [!NOTE]
> Anchor text must always be lowercase and not contain spaces.

## XRef (cross reference) links

XRef links are the recommended way to link to APIs, because they make it easy to customize the link text. Additionally, they're validated at build time, and if the URL to the API reference were to change, the link would still work. To link to auto-generated API reference pages in the current docset or other docsets, use XRef links with the unique ID ([UID](#determine-the-uid)) of the type or member.

> [!TIP]
> The [API Reference Link Helper extension for VS Code](https://github.com/IEvangelist/xref-helper) makes it super easy to insert .NET API Xref links into Markdown and XML files.

Check if the API you want to link to is published on [Microsoft Learn](/) by typing all or some of its full name in the [.NET API browser][] or [Windows UWP][] search box. If you don't see any results displayed, the type isn't yet on Microsoft Learn.

You can use one of the following syntaxes:

- Auto-links:

   ```markdown
   <xref:UID>
   <xref:UID?displayProperty=nameWithType>
   ```

   By default, link text shows only the member or type name. The optional `displayProperty=nameWithType` query parameter produces fully qualified link text, that is, **namespace.type** for types, and **type.member** for type members, including enumeration type members.

- Markdown-style links:

   ```markdown
   [link text](xref:UID)
   ```

   Use Markdown-style links for XRef when you want to customize the link text that's displayed.

Examples:

- **\<xref:System.String>** displays as <xref:System.String>

- **\<xref:System.String?displayProperty=nameWithType>** displays as
  <xref:System.String?displayProperty=nameWithType>

- **\[String class](xref:System.String)** displays as [String class](xref:System.String).

The `displayProperty=fullName` query parameter works the same way as `displayProperty=nameWithType` for classes. That is, the link text becomes **namespace.classname**. However, for members, the link text displays as **namespace.classname.membername**, which might be undesirable.

> [!NOTE]
> UIDs are case sensitive. For example, `<xref:System.Object>` resolves correctly, but `<xref:system.object>` does not.

### Determine the UID

The UID is usually the fully qualified class or member name. To determine the UID, right-click on the [Microsoft Learn](/) page for a type or member, select **View source**, and then copy the **content** value for **ms.assetid**.

![ms.assetid in source for web page](media/how-to-write-links/ms-assetid.png)

### Percent-encoding of URLs

Special characters in the UID need to be [percent-encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) as follows:

| Character | HTML encoding |
| --------- | ------------- |
| `*`       | *           |

Encoding example:

- `System.Exception.#ctor` encodes as `System.Exception.%23ctor`

### Generic types

Generic types are those types such as `System.Collections.Generic.List<T>`. If you browse to this type in the [.NET API browser](/dotnet/api/) and look at its URL, you see that `<T>` is written as `-1` in the URL, which actually represents **`1**:

`https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.list-1`

### Methods

To link to a method, you can either link to the general method page by adding an asterisk (`*`) after the method name, or to a specific overload. For example, use the general page when you want to link to the `<xref:System.Object.Equals*?displayProperty=nameWithType>` method without specific parameter types. For example:

`<xref:System.Object.Equals*?displayProperty=nameWithType>` links to <xref:System.Object.Equals*?displayProperty=nameWithType>

To link to a specific overload, add parenthesis after the method name and include the full type name of each parameter. Do not put a space character between the type names or the link won't work. For example:

`<xref:System.Object.Equals(System.Object,System.Object)?displayProperty=nameWithType>` links to <xref:System.Object.Equals(System.Object,System.Object)?displayProperty=nameWithType>

## Links from includes

Because include files are located in another directory, you must use longer relative paths. To link to an article from an include file, use this format:

```markdown
[link text](../articles/folder/article-name.md)
```

> [!TIP]
> The [Learn Authoring Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=docsmsft.docs-authoring-pack) extension for Visual Studio Code helps you insert relative links and bookmarks correctly without the tedium of figuring out paths.

## Links in selectors

A selector is a navigation component that appears in a docs article as a drop-down list. When a reader selects a value in the drop-down, the browser opens the selected article. Typically the selector list contains links to closely related articles, for example the same subject matter in multiple programming languages or a closely related series of articles.

If you have selectors that are embedded in an include, use the following link structure:

   ```markdown
   > [AZURE.SELECTOR-LIST (Dropdown1 | Dropdown2 )]
   - [(Text1 | Example1 )](../articles/folder/article-name1.md)
   - [(Text1 | Example2 )](../articles/folder/article-name2.md)
   - [(Text2 | Example3 )](../articles/folder/article-name3.md)
   - [(Text2 | Example4 )](../articles/folder/article-name4.md)
   ```

## Reference-style links

You can use reference-style links to make your source content easier to read. Reference-style links replace inline link syntax with simplified syntax that allows you to move the long URLs to the end of the article. Here's [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) 's example:

Inline text:

   ```markdown
   I get 10 times more traffic from [Google][1] than from [Yahoo][2] or [MSN][3].
   ```

Link references at the end of the article:

   ```markdown
   <!--Reference links in article-->
   [1]: http://google.com/
   [2]: http://search.yahoo.com/
   [3]: http://search.msn.com/
   ```

Make sure that you include the space after the colon, before the link. When you link to other technical articles, if you forget to include the space, the link will be broken in the published article.

## Links to pages that are not part of the technical documentation set

To link to a page on another Microsoft property (such as a pricing page, SLA page, or anything else that is not a documentation article), use an absolute URL, but omit the locale. The goal here is that links work in GitHub and on the rendered site:

   ```markdown
   [link text](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines/)
   ```

## Links to third-party sites

The best user experience minimizes sending users to another site. So base any links to third-party sites, which we do sometimes need, on this info:

- **Accountability**: Link to third-party content when it's the third-party's information to share. For example, it's not Microsoft's place to tell people how to use Android developer tools--that is Google's story to tell. If we need to, we can explain how to use Android developer tools *with* Azure, but Google should tell the story of how to use their tools.
- **PM signoff**: Request that Microsoft sign off on third-party content. By linking to it, we are saying something about our trust in it and our obligation if people follow the instructions.
- **Freshness reviews**: Make sure that the third-party info is still current, correct, and relevant, and that the link hasn't changed.
- **Offsite**: Make users aware that they are going to another site. If the context does not make that clear, add a qualifying phrase. For example: "Prerequisites include the Android Developer Tools, which you can download on the Android Studio site."
- **Next steps**: It's fine to add a link to, say, an MVP blog in a "Next steps" section. Again, just make sure that users understand they'll be leaving the site.
- **Legal**: We are covered legally under **Links to Third Party Sites** in the **Terms of Use** footer on every microsoft.com page.
