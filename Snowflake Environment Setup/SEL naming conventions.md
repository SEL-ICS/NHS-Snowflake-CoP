# 📘 Naming Conventions – South East London ICB Analytics Team

Welcome to the **Naming Conventions** section of our repository!

This section outlines the naming standards and practices adopted by the **South East London Integrated Care Board (SEL ICB) Analytics Team** when we began our journey with **Snowflake** as our cloud data warehouse platform.

## 🧭 Purpose

Establishing consistent naming conventions was one of our first steps in building a scalable, maintainable, and collaborative data environment. These conventions help ensure:

- Clarity and consistency across datasets and environments
- Easier onboarding for new team members
- Improved collaboration across teams and partners
- Better alignment with Snowflake’s best practices

## 📐 What’s Included

In this section, you’ll find:
- Our approach to naming databases, schemas, tables, views, and other Snowflake objects
- Guidelines for abbreviations, casing, and delimiters
- Examples and rationale behind key decisions
- Tips for adapting these conventions to evolving needs

## 🤝 Who It’s For

This guidance is intended for:
- Data engineers and analysts working within South East London ICB
- Partner organizations collaborating on shared data projects
- Anyone interested in adopting or adapting a structured naming approach for Snowflake
